== Define the problem

Your user will also be in the middle of something: define the starting-point that they know how to reach and a conclusion that answers a real question.

- xref:{docref}/doc-reference.adoc[Quarkus documentation reference]

== Guidelines for good How-To guides

- Donâ€™t explain concepts; link to a related concept/explainer
- Be flexible; a how-to guide needs to be adaptable to real-world use-cases.
- Omit the unnecessary; practical usability is more helpful than completeness.

== Examples

Baeldung tutorials provide solid examples of How-To guides. For example, "How to use Jackson annotations" is answered (with variations) here: https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-annotations
