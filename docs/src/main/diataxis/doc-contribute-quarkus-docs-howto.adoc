Quarkus welcomes community contributions, and improvements to documentation can be a great place to get started: your contributions make things better for everyone, and you don't have to be an expert to make a meaningful change.

== Prerequisites

If you want to contribute to Quarkus docs, we suggest you have the following materials nearby:

- An editor or IDE that provides syntax highlighting and previews for asciidoc, either natively or using a plugin.
- The xref:{docref}/doc-reference.adoc[Quarkus documentation reference] for required syntax and other conventions.

== Sources

Quarkus docs are built from source written using {asciidoc}[Asciidoc] syntax.

- Documentation for Quarkus core and most extensions is located in the `docs` directory of the {quarkus-docs}[Quarkus GitHub repository].
- Docs for Quarkiverse or other third-party extensions are pulled directly from those repositories.
